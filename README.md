# Centralized-and-Decentralized-Supply-Chain-Planning
This Repository is used to Plan the Production and Distributio for Centralized and Decentralized Supply Chains using Autonomous Agents
There are two Paradigms that are used as the control strategies for the supply chains planning. These are Centralized Supply Chain Planning and the Decentralized Supply Chain Planning.
In centralized Supply chain planning, there is a single decision maker and all the information about costs, capacities of producer and distributor are shared to the single decision maker. 
In Decentralized supply chain planning paradigm the two agents, namely, Producer and distributor have their own objective of minimizing the costs of their own domain and there is alck of trust between them.
Hence, the Production Agent and Distributor Agent will share only partial information.

and there is ccoordination mechanism between the two Agents.

The work is coded in GAMS modelling software and used neos optimization server to solve the problem.
